Please provide me with more context! 

For example, tell me:

* **What kind of guide do you want?** 
    * How to train a Leo the Lion (the character)?
    * How to draw a Leo the Lion?
    * How to write a story about Leo the Lion?
    * How to build a Leo the Lion costume?
* **Who is the target audience?** 
    * Children? Adults?
* **What is the tone of the guide?** 
    * Funny? Serious? Informative?

The more information you give me, the better I can tailor the guide to your needs!
